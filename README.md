In our work we have proposed a system that generates an unbiased,short and crisp review for movies by combining the overall reviews posted by thousands of users online.This 
eliminates the tedious process of users going through 
multiple sources for getting an overall and legit review on 
movies they wish to watch . The system also carries out 
sentiment analysis on the reviews posted by users and gives 
an overall score on how positive or negative the response 
has been. 
This is an indispensable tool for both movie-goers and 
the film industry, providing them with valuable information, 
insights, and feedback that can help enhance the movie
watching experience for all parties involved.
